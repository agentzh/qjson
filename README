This is a fork of the QJson C++ Qt library by agentzh and xunxin.

This fork fixes the UTF-8 bugs and the not-so-natural build system
with qmake. And we'd expect it eventually merged back to the mainstream.

Installation

 $ qmake 'CONFIG-=debug' OUTPUT_DIR=/prefix/yqjson -r
 $ make
 $ make install

If you want to install to the system, specify
OUTPUT_DIR=/usr/local explicitly in the first step.

The default value of OUTPUT_DIR is the current build directory.

For RPM/Debian/... packaging, one can specify a "DESTDIR" while
installing, for instance,

 $ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/home/agentz/rpm/BUILDROOT/qjson

The main motivation for this library is our VdomBrowser mainly for
webpage information extraction based on VDOM:

Here comes the original README for the mainstream QJson:

Description
-----------
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
  It can represents integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of value, and a collection of name/value pairs.

  QJson is a qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects.
  JSON arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances, while JSON's objects will be mapped to QVariantMap.

Happy hacking
